    <h2> Poem: "Love is not All"</h2>

    <p class="poem">
        Love is not all: it is not meat nor drink
        <br> </br>
        Nor slumber nor a roof against the rain;
        <br> </br>
        Nor yet a floating spar to men that sink
        <br> </br>
        And rise and sink and rise and sink again;
        <br> </br>
        Love can not fill the thickened lung with breath,  
        <br> </br>                                                                        
        Nor clean the blood, nor set the fractured bone;
        <br> </br>
        Yet many a man is making friends with death
        <br> </br>
        Even as I speak for lack of love alone.
        <br> </br>
        It well may be that in a difficult hour,
        <br> </br>
        Pinned down by pain and moaning for release,    
        <br> </br>                                                                        
        Or nagged by want past resolutionâ€™s power,
        <br> </br>
        I might be driven to sell your love for peace,
        <br> </br>
        r trade the memory of this night for food.
        <br> </br>
        It well may be. I do not think I would.
